This is a naive (and incomplete) implementation of a Nintendo™ Game Boy™ emulator in Elixir,
using the [Scenic library](https://hex.pm/packages/scenic). In no way does this
"project" endorse piracy, nor is this meant to be used for piracy purposes. 
The only goal was to learn and share any knowledge gained by hacking this
emulator together.

Use/research at your risk! If this project eats your homework or you end up in 
any trouble, it's on you.

In order to run this, you'll have to find the BOOT ROM and a digital version of
the game you have at home ;)
